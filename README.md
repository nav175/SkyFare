### A Flight Ticket Price Finder Web App  

## GitHub Repository
[Project Repository](https://github.com/CMPT-276-SPRING-2025/final-project-19-leafs)

## Our Project
Booking a flight can be stressful—bouncing between websites, comparing prices, and checking flight statuses takes a lot of time and effort. Our project makes this process easier by giving users a simple, all-in-one platform to search for flights, compare prices, and get real-time updates. Plus, with the help of an AI-powered chatbot, users can get instant assistance, making the experience smoother and more interactive.

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CMPT-276-SPRING-2025/final-project-19-leafs.git
cd final-project-19-leafs
```
### 2. Install Netlify CLI
In order to run the project locally, you'll need to install the Netlify CLI. You can do this using npm with the following command:

 ```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
``` 
Note: If you don't have npm installed, refer to the Node.js installation to install it first.

### 3. Run the Local Development Server
Since the netlify.toml file is already included in the repository, you don't need to create it manually. Now, you can simply run the following command to start the local development server:

```bash
netlify dev
```
This will start the server and provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8888).

You should see the following message in your terminal:

``` bash
◈ Server now ready on http://localhost:8888
```
Now, open `http://localhost:8888` in your browser to see the project running locally.

### 4. Access the Live Project
